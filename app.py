# Google Drive file ID for your vgg16_brain_tumor.keras.zip file.
# IMPORTANT: This ID must be for a zip file where 'vgg16_brain_tumor.keras'
#            is at the root level of the zip's contents.
#            Example: If you open the zip, you should immediately see
#            'vgg16_brain_tumor.keras' folder, and inside that, 'model.weights.h5'.
#            Or even better, if the zip contains directly 'model.weights.h5',
#            'config.json', 'metadata.json'.
#            The previous screenshot showed 'vgg16_brain_tumor.keras' as the directory
#            containing these files. So, the zip should contain the *contents*
#            of that 'vgg16_brain_tumor.keras' folder, or the folder itself at the root.
#            Given the error, it's likely the zip contains:
#            your_zip.zip/
#            â””â”€â”€ vgg16_brain_tumor.keras/

#                â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json
#                â””â”€â”€ model.weights.h5
#            This is what the code expects.
